      I started cooking since I was in middle school when I had to cook a meal for my younger sister. I started with a very simple food such as instant noodle and rice. Then I started to spark off my cooking style when I moved out in my early 20’s for university. Buying fast food was cheap but not particularly healty, and restaurants were just too expensive for students.
      So, I started with some basics, but as I learned more about cooking and discovered that I could cook a delicious meal for a fraction of the cost. I started reading and watching tutorials about cooking, and I learned more advanced techniques and found interesting recipes.
      I got good at cooking relatively fast because I enjoyed cooking and found that I liked seeing others loving my cooking.

      Can you guess my next hobby from the picture? If you haven't guessed it, it's Breakdancing (and sort of working out). I started to dance in high school with my best friends because we thought it was cool and though it would make us unique.
      As I danced longer, I saw many other good aspects of it. I was a shy person who couldn't go up to strangers and start a conversation. Through dancing, I was able to overcome the fear. Secondly, it made me into a persistent person. Breakdancing was very challenging
      as one goes through many injuries and needs to practice consistently. Unfortunately, people can breakdance until late 30s because body starts to become weaker so you are more prone to injuries. But I think I will try to enjoy dancing as much as I can to make good use of my youth energy because I think I will regret it if I don't try hard now.

      <div class="text"> Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The game is played by millions of people worldwide. Chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game chaturanga some time before the 7th century. The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century; the modern rules were standardized in the 19th century.
