  <img class="game" src="img/azpoker.png" style="height: 300px; width:500px">
  <p class = "game_info"> I love playing poker, especially with my good-old friends. At the same time, I also like to change the rules of the original game to my own. One day, I decided to create my
    own version of poker. I named it AZ poker because there is a wild card called "Z" that can turn into any card that will always change your hand to a better hand as possible.
    The highest hand you can make is what I call "Emperor Straight Flush, meaning your hand consists of ""A","K","Q","J" with same suit and "Z".
    The deck consists of 66 cards because it has 5 suits and the wild card. I used my math skill I acquired in school to calculate the possibility of the highest winning hand and it turns out, you have 0.0023% chance to get it!You can try playing it by downloading directly from my github. 
    I used language python to build it few years ago but I am currently working on re-modeling the game using node.js to play it on discord.

    <img class="game" src="img/deathclock.png" style="height: 300px; width:500px">
    <p class = "game_info"> I have made few games using Discord.js. I would like to introduce them. 
        I made 5 way Rock-Paper-Scissors game, or should I call it, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.
        Rock beats Scissors and Lizard, Scissors beats Paper and Lizard, Paper beats Rock and Spock, Lizard beats Paper and Spock, finally, Spock beats Rock and Scissors! 
        Phew, I hope that isn't too hard to remember right? It's super simple to play, just type any of the 5 options after "!". ex) !rock
        
        Next one is a guessing game. Computer will generate 5 random 5 numbers after the command "!guess". You can start guessing the numbers after until you get the reach 
        the correct answer, then the bot will tell you if you how many you got it right. ex) !guess 13495
      
        Lastly, the most advanced and bit more complicated game I made. I find games that requires strategic thinking not only challenging but fun as well.
      The rule is... You are standing on a random position of clock. On your turn, you have a choice to move either up or down by 1 or 2. There are 3 obstacles to avoid, which are the second-hand, the minute-hand, and the hour-hand. All 3 moves differently but in a consistant pattern.
      Your challenge is to avoid them for 10 turns. The tip is to figure out your current position, where the hands are located and how many steps it moves.
      This game may seem entirely luck based but it can be done using a strategy. If you like strategy games, you should try this game out by inviting my bot to your discord channel. I challenge you to beat the hardest mode. Click the icon, invite the bot to your channel, type !clock to begin.

      I started cooking since I was in middle school when I had to cook a meal for my younger sister. I started with a very simple food such as instant noodle and rice. Then I started to spark off my cooking style when I moved out in my early 20’s for university. Buying fast food was cheap but not particularly healty, and restaurants were just too expensive for students.
      So, I started with some basics, but as I learned more about cooking and discovered that I could cook a delicious meal for a fraction of the cost. I started reading and watching tutorials about cooking, and I learned more advanced techniques and found interesting recipes.
      I got good at cooking relatively fast because I enjoyed cooking and found that I liked seeing others loving my cooking.

      Can you guess my next hobby from the picture? If you haven't guessed it, it's Breakdancing (and sort of working out). I started to dance in high school with my best friends because we thought it was cool and though it would make us unique.
      As I danced longer, I saw many other good aspects of it. I was a shy person who couldn't go up to strangers and start a conversation. Through dancing, I was able to overcome the fear. Secondly, it made me into a persistent person. Breakdancing was very challenging
      as one goes through many injuries and needs to practice consistently. Unfortunately, people can breakdance until late 30s because body starts to become weaker so you are more prone to injuries. But I think I will try to enjoy dancing as much as I can to make good use of my youth energy because I think I will regret it if I don't try hard now.
