	<p><b>Language:</b>Discord.js</p>
	<p><b>On-going hobby:</b> Started Summer 2018</p>

	<!-- THE INTERNSHIP -->
	<div class="phase">
		<h2>The Story</h2>
		<p>School assignments are nice such as building a bank system, user profile, alarm clock, etc. But I like to code something that involves more user-interaction. I use discord a lot to talk to my friends and play games. So, I created a discord channel along with my discord bots. Let's see what my bots can do! </p>
	</div>


	<!-- PROJECT DETAILS -->
	<div class="phase">
		<h2>First Step</h2>
		<p> To develop a discord bot, I had to learn few things.   - NodeJS Setup and Ready Event Setup. <br> After understanding the set-up, I decided to make a bot that can send welcome messages to new members who joins my channel. When it worked, I found it entertaining and wanted to make something more difficult. </p>

	<div class="phase">
		<h2>Second Step</h2>
		<p> One of key feature in discord is having a role which constructs a hierarchy among members in the channel. Unfortunately, only the manager of the channel could assign roles to members. This created an inconvenience to regular members for not being able to get/remove roles when they wanted. I thought that this problem could be handled by using bot. Which turned out to be great and my channel member loves using it.
		Every year, I have been upgrading this system for my members to use it more easily.</p>

	<p> <b> 2018 Version </b> - Auto-role assigning by text: Some members does not know the exact name or command to execute the bot correctly</p>

	<br>
	<p> <b> 2019 Version </b> - Auto-role assigning by emoji: Big gaps between each messages/taking too much space/repetition of words</p>

	<br>
	<p> <b> 2020 Version </b> - Auto-role assigning by emoji/embed: Clean design/Shows all available roles in one embeded function</p>

	<div class="phase">
		<h2>Third Step</h2>
		<p> I thought that people might need more entertainment in my channel. Most general thought that came through my mind was a game. Here, I created few games such as guessing numbers, rock-paper-scissors and a survival game.</p>
	</div>

	<p> <b> Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock </b> </p> <p> - Simple game to play. Just type any of the 5 options after `!` and then the bot will pick their option immediately. Play quick for fun!</p>
